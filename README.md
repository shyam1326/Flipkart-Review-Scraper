Web scraping is a technique using which the webpages from the internet are fetched and parsed to understand and extract specific information similar to a human being. Web scrapping consists of two parts:
• Web Crawling→ Accessing the webpages over the internet and pulling data from them.
• HTML Parsing→ Parsing the HTML content of the webpages obtained through web crawling and then extracting specific information from it.
Hence, web scrappers are applications/bots, which automatically send requests to websites and then extract the desired information from the website output.
Let’s take an example:
how do we buy a phone online?
1. We first look for a phone with good reviews
2. We see on which website it’s available at the lowest price
3. We check whether it’s delivered in our area or not
4. If everything looks good, then we buy the phone.
What if there is a computer program that can do all of these for us? That’s what web scrappers necessarily do. They try to understand the webpage content as a human would do.
Other examples of the applications of web scrapping are:
• Competitive pricing.
• Manufacturers monitor the market, whether the retailer is maintaining a minimum price or not.
• Sentiment analysis of the consumers, whether they are happy with the services and products or not.
